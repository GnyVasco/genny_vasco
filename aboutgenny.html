                    <p>Hi, my name is <span class="highlight">Genny Vasco</span>. I have over two years of experience in Product Design, working remotely with both local and international teams, collaborating closely with developers, managers and graphic designers.</p>

                What drives my work is simple: creating technology that solves real problems without placing more barriers in front of people.
                </p>
                <p class="pitch-description">
                    I've contributed as a Product Designer at 99 Interactions, MOZDEVZ, and as volunteer at GDSC and PyCon I contributed to help young Mozambican developers share their knowledge in Tech and help organizations improve their Digital products.

                <p class="pitch-description">
                    Through that work, I’ve gained not just professional experience, but also a clear sense of purpose: to collaborate with teams that value thoughtful, evidence-based software development and community impact. Especially now, in the age of AI, staying human-centered is essential.
                </p>
                
                <p class="pitch-description">
                That’s why I’m currently sharpening my skills through ALX Africa’s Data Science program, focusing on research methods, data analysis, and quantitative reasoning. I believe design decisions shouldn’t rely just on intuition but on real patterns and behaviors.

                <h2>My process usually looks like this:</h2>
                <ul>Desk research, quantitative and qualitative research
                Brainstorming ideas, testing them, and iterating with my team
                Handoff and UX advocacy, ensuring the product stays clear, functional, and human-centered</ul>
                <p>
                    I believe in getting ideas into people’s hands early, learning from what works, and improving through quick iterations.

                    My strongest skills today include user research, prototyping, and agile product development. I work best in teams that care as much about the process as they do about the result.

                I believe technology in Africa doesn’t need to look like copy-paste versions of products from elsewhere. <span>We can create our own. Thoughtful, well-researched, human-centered, made for African youth, and anyone else trying to do good work that helps people live better.</span>
